ModeSet Onboarding Flow (v1)
Goal

Get the user from zero → fully functional personas with minimal friction.
Onboarding must feel like “setting up magic,” not configuring a phone.

1. Welcome Screen

Header:
Switch your phone’s personality in one tap.

Subtext:
ModeSet creates multiple “personas” for your iPhone — Study, Social, and Private — and swaps them instantly using QR codes or app triggers.

Button:
Get Started

2. Persona Set Creation

User sees a “Starter Personas” screen with three defaults:

1. Study

Focus-only environment, minimal UI, no social apps, dimmed brightness.

2. Social

Full notifications, bright wallpaper, messaging apps visible.

3. Private

Safe-screen mode, notifications suppressed, minimal visible apps.

User taps: Continue
ModeSet pre-generates persona IDs and internal structure.

3. Permission Granting

A sequence of permission cards appears one at a time:

A. Shortcuts Access

Needed to switch wallpapers, brightness, and Focus.
Button: Allow in Settings

B. Notification Access

Needed to apply persona-specific notification behavior.
Button: Allow

C. Wallpaper Access

Needed to set persona wallpapers.
Button: Allow Full Access

D. Camera Access (QR)

Needed to scan persona-switching QR codes.
Button: Allow

Each permission is separated to reduce cognitive load.

4. Focus Mode Setup

Screen text:

“iOS needs three Focus Modes so ModeSet can transform your phone instantly.”

User taps Create Focus Modes

For each persona (Study, Social, Private), ModeSet opens the iOS Focus creation UI pre-filled with:

Focus name

Allowed apps

Allowed people

Lock Screen preset

Home Screen page visibility

User taps Done for each.

5. Shortcut Installation

ModeSet shows:

“Install Shortcuts to enable persona switching.”

User installs:

Activate Study Mode

Activate Social Mode

Activate Private Mode

ModeSet Switcher (master shortcut)

Each added via “Add Shortcut” button.

6. Final Persona Test

Screen:

“Try switching your phone’s personality.”

App displays 3 QR codes:

Study

Social

Private

User taps Open Camera
Scans “Study”
Focus Mode activates → wallpaper switches → home screen shifts → brightness changes.

If successful:

“You’re done. Your phone now has personalities.”

Button:
Finish Setup
